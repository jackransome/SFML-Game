global clock
	attached to ticking sound
	can have this change for dif situations or moves?
	or sync w some music

all moves are synced to global clock
moves can add events that:
	block incoming damage
	do damage to an enemy
	set up something for next clock cycle, or more in the future
	things happening at the same time have synergy
temporarily slow downs time

moves are basically just bindings between controls and the creation of events

event data structure:
	source (player / enemy id)
	type
	run()
		can see what other events are happening at the same time
		can add new events in the future
		can deal damage, block damage, etc
	
	
	

items can:
	add a new move
	add a new synergy between evisting events

example start:
	obtain item that  gives attack move
	obtain item that gives windup move
	now with this amount of damage you can one shot an enemy, that normally regenerates health before your next attack


target areas:
	close: closest point in an x radius around the player to the mouse
	far: mouse position

events:
	windup:
		adds "windup done" event 1 beat later
	simple attack:
		does 10 damage to close target area
		does extra 10 damage if windup done event happens simultaneuously

object collection:
	should maintain vectors of pointers to specific types of objects inside itself

structure of event type storage:
	id
	list of ids of events to create, with times in future, with any conditions (concurrent events) for the creation of these events
	list of actions to do, eg to damage at close target area, do healing at far target area

actions:
	(all have amount)
	do damage at close target area
	do damage at far target area
	do damage to self
	do healing to self
	do healing at close target area
	do healing at far target area
	play sound
	addscreenshake

timing:
	there is a global clock, events dont have to happen on each tick, can happen anytime, but triggers etc are added by amounts of time that are multiples of the time between beats in the global clock
